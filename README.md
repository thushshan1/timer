# Timer
### a MGTC28 Python example
This is a timer program written in Python  

![times-up!](https://media.makeameme.org/created/times-up-5923e0.jpg)\
timer.py is a simple Python script which dictates a game of stand up.
Initially, the players will see the words "Player Stand".
A random amount of time will be set for the time of the game.
Upon timer expiry, the players will see the time-up phrase.
timer.py uses the **time library** to help keep track of time and the **pillow library** to facilitate the meme display, as well as the **random library** to set the random time.

Please see the documentation for the library used:
- [time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html)
- [pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
- [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)
